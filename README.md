### Uh oh, so someone _finally_ found my profile. Well umm hi there! 👋

*I feel nothing but everlasting pain on this account.*

I'm Alphen. I’m currently learning C++, JavaScript and HTML. I also know some Java (just a little), Visual Basic for Applications (yeah, Excel 🌱) and Python. 
I hate coffee and I only drink, well, water. (and tea on sundays).
I'll upload my funkeh funni projects to here, so some random 13 year old kid called Lincoln can steal my code.

You can also use any pronoun you want, I don't really mind.
